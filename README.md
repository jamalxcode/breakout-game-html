**Breakout Game** is a modern reimagining of the classic arcade hit. Move your paddle left and right—using your mouse, keyboard, or touch—and keep the ball in play to destroy all bricks at the top of the screen. Play instantly in any modern browser.

## How K2 Think Was Used

This project leverages `K2 Think`—an advanced AI code-assist and productivity platform—to accelerate the game's design and development. K2 Think was used to:
- Generate HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript templates,
- Provide optimized logic for paddle/ball movement, collision handling, and rendering,
- Suggest UI enhancements (score, game over, etc.),
- Accelerate prototyping and game structure design.

## Gameplay

- **Controls**:  
  - **Mouse**: Move your mouse over the game area to control the paddle smoothly and precisely.
  - **Keyboard**: Use the Left and Right arrow keys.
  - **Touch**: Playable on touch devices for mobile browser users.
